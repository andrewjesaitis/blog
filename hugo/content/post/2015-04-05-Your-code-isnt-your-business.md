*What's really is your business? It's serving your users and fullfilling their trust
*Maybe there is a case for not opensourcing pre-production (first mover advantage-though this is overblown -- Meercat was built in two week)
*Code itself is not a creative work like a painting or photo
*Advantages
*Secure
*Contributes to the commons
*Free devs!
*Keeps the fire lit under your ass
*Fully realize the realistic burden to open source a large code base
*We all have committed that hard coded password or secret key (OS bonus: doesn't allow you to do stupid shit like this)
*Why this wouldn't hurt your buisness
*Users trust you (or they should)
*You better be delivering value above and beyond the pure product commodity
*Case studies
*Netflix (nobody else has the content deals)
*Facebook(network effect)
*Android
*Wordpress
