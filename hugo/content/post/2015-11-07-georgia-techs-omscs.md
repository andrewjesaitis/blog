"Ugghhh. Why won't this work," I digustedly say as I push myself away from may desk and walk back to my kitchen to make another cup of tea.

It's 10 pm on a Sunday night and I'm working on an assigment due in my Computer Vison class tomorrow. The plan was to have had it all wrapped up by 3 pm, but the clock swiftly rolled past that milestone as I struggled to morph one image into another.

Feelings of frustration and struggle are nothing new for students. As a Math major in college, I'm intimately familar with both feelings developed over hours of trying to conceptualize concepts that cannot be vizualized. The difference is now, these feelings add to the stress that we each have from our work. And unlike many jobs in college, when we leave the office our shift isn't over. Instead, we now just consider the challeges facing our companies from a new location.

The new online Master's of Science degree offered by Georgia Tech isn't some watered down version of the residental version. It is a faithful copy of the work and content that on campus students are exposed to. It's hard. It's often unrelenting. And extremely valuable.

Outsiders are sometimes dismissive of the program thinking that it will dilute Georgia Tech's reputation by translating their prestigious program into a Massively Open Online Course (MOOC). These people miss two important aspects.

### It's not a MOOC
It's easy to see some video lectures and that enrollment takes place online and conclude that this is just another set of MOOCs. However, the program is actually neither massive, nor truely open. Classes are limited to about 200 students, no larger than large undergraduate courses. As students are added so too must an army of TA's be recruited to help ansewer questions and grade deliberately subjective assigments.

For example, in a course called "Knowledge Based AI" I ended up writing more than 100 pages explaining diffent aspects of the rapidly growing field. Topics ranged from discussing the architecture of SOAR to different planning techniques to how we implemented different cognitive processes in our own AI agents that we developed over the course of a semester. Obviously, this type of essay content isn't typical of a MOOC since it cannot be graded automatically.

Unlike say "Chemistry 102", the professor isn't teaching to the lowest common denominator. The professor lectures at a level independent of the student, the level at which they feel the material should be understood. Since the lecture is pre-recorded, there are no tangents or derailments due to questions. The end result is an extremely information dense lecture. Some professor's estimate that they cover an hours worth traditionally delivered material every fifteen minutes. When the average weekly lecture lenght for the OMSCS is 3 hours, it's easily to realize how this adds up.

### Inverting the Metrics
The second dismisal leveled against that program is that it somehow dilutes the value of the degree. This is flawed logic resting on the concept that the value of a degree rests on it's scarcity. This prevelent mode of thinking has been perpetuated by the drive to go to ultra-selective university's and using the credential as a fast pass to a great job.

Arguablely, software development bucks this trend since it is a skills based profession. Even if you went to MIT and somehow managed to graduate without knowing how to code, you still wouldn't be hired. Almost every technical position requires candiates to demostrate their skills by coding on a whiteboard, solving a toy problem, or completing a project.

Instead, the OMSCS program does away with defining the value of the degree based on scarcity and instead defines it based on the level of the content. In short, if you can hack it in the program, you deserve the credential reguardless of your previous background, legacy status, or luck.

### Hacking it
Doing well in the program isn't easy either.
