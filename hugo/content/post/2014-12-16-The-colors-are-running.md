title: The colors are running away in fear

This week the senate released it's [500 page "executive summary"](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/12/09/world/cia-torture-report-document.html) of the CIA's behavior during the Bush Administration. None of it is particularly surprising, the US tortured people.

However, it shouldn't take 500 pages to express what our position **should** be on torture. I'll do it in two sentences.

*The US had a covert program to torture suspected terrorists following 9/11. This is wrong and will never be allowed to happen again.*

Torture is a clear example of where utilitarianism fails. It is wrong in a absolute moral sense. There is no justification--no ticking time bomb, no evidence gathering, nothing.

More disgusting is what the debate has devolved into. Now it is framed as a question, "Did we get any good information from these reprehensible practices?" This question misses the point. Torture is always wrong--*full stop*. There are few things that I agree with John McCain on, but this is one of them.

You know those shirts that the "patriots" used to wear that said these colors don't run...Well guess what, they became so enveloped with moral cowardice that they started sprinting away from the foundations that make America great.
