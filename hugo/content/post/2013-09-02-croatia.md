title: Lost in Croatia

I just got back from a fantastic trip to Croatia with my sister.

Since she lives in London I spent the first 4 days of the trip exploring the city and getting over my jet lag. Oh man, was the jet lag bad this time. I'm still not sure exactly what happened, but I found myself in a weeklong pattern of not sleeping one night and then sleeping 14 hours the next.

We flew out to Dubrovnik from London on a Sunday afternoon and arrived at our rented apartment by 10 pm. While it is certainly worth it to pay for a place close to the old town, I wouldn't want to stay inside the actual walls. It would just be a pain in the neck to haul your bags on foot up hundreds of steps to find your apartment.

The food in Dubrovnik was great! Two highlights were Buffet Kamenice and Taj Mahal. Kamenice serves mediteran style seafood dishes and Taj Mahal serves Bosnian cusine. Both were amazing!

In terms of sightseeing, I found the tour of the city walls to be really great and visting the War Photo Ltd gallery was reminder to the tragic war-torn history of the area.

Next we drove up to Plitviƒçka National Park. It's a pretty easy drive taking about 7 hours. This is a fairyland of waterfalls and broadwalks above emerald green water. It's really stunning.

Finally, we drove up to Split and departed for the island of Brac by ferry. We stayed in the town of Bol and this was by far my favorite part of the trip. The beaches were spectacular. In fact, [Zlatni Rat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlatni_Rat) has been repeated named as one of the most beatiful beaches in the world. I also had the best meal of the trip at the Mali Raj which is very close to Zlatni Rat (Hint: Get the Denton).

After, a few days in Bol it was time for a travel decatholon to get back to London - ferry, bus, plane, train, car, foot. We spent a couple days recovering from that adventure and then it was sadly time for me to head back to Bozeman.

## Quick Take:

Croatia is amazing. But, if you know what you are looking for in a vacation you could fine tune your itineray instead of trying to do it all.
