## Hi! I'm Andrew.

I graduated from [Whitman College](https://www.whitman.edu/) with a degree in Economics and Math. Subsequently I worked as an analyst for Goldman Sachs until the end of 2009. After escaping with my soul intact, I worked for [Golden Helix](http://www.goldenhelix.com) as a Software Developer and Product Manager. I received Master's in Computer Science from [Georgia Tech](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/) in 2016. Currently, I'm doing freelance development (general software and bioinformatics) work while I find the next big thing that I want to work on. I'm also an active contributor to the [Global Alliance for Global Health](https://github.com/ga4gh/).

I love living in Bozeman, MT. I never realized how lucky I had it until I left. Where else can you be climbing in 10 minutes, skiing in 20 minutes, or ice climbing in 40 minutes.
