## Hi! I'm Andrew.

I graduated from [Whitman College](https://www.whitman.edu/) with a degree in Economics and Math. Subsequently I worked as an analyst for Goldman Sachs until the end of 2009. After escaping with my soul intact, I worked for [Golden Helix](http://www.goldenhelix.com) as a Software Developer and Product Manager. Now I attend [Georgia Tech](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/) and am pursuing my Master's in Computer Science with an emphasis in computational perception and robotics (expected 2016). I'm also an active contributor to the [Global Alliance for Global Health](https://github.com/ga4gh/).

I love living in Bozeman, MT. I never realized how lucky I had it until I left. Where else can you be climbing in 10 minutes, skiing in 20 minutes, or ice climbing in 40 minutes.

Even though I'm powered by coffee, I can never pass up cup of good [Pu-erh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pu-erh_tea). I like other teas too and rate them over at [Steepster](http://steepster.com/andrewjesaitis).
